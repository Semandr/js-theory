## What I have learned about functions:

- [Default parameters](#default-parametrs)

## Default-parameters

### What I learned:

- Sometimes it's useful to have functions where some parameters are set by default. This way we do not have to pass them in manually in case we don't want to change the default.
- The default values are can contain any expression.
- We can't skip arguments here when we called a function.

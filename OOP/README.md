## What I have learned in this section of the JS theory, all about OOP:

- OOP in JS
- Constructor functions and the **new** Operator
- Prototypes
- Prototypal Inheritance and chain
- Prototypal Inheritance on Built-in Objects
- **ES6 Classes**
- Set and get
- Method **Object.create()**
- Inheritance between Classes: Costructor Functions, ES6 Classes and Object.create()
- **Encapsulation**: Protected properties, methods, private fields.
- Chaining methods

## What I have learned in this section of the JS theory:

- [Destructuring Arrays](#destructing-arrays)
- [Destructuring Objects](#destructuring-objects)
- [Spread Operator (...)](#spread)
- [Rest Operator (...)](#rest)
- [Short Circuiting (&& and ||)](#short-circuiting)

## Destructing-arrays

### What I learned:

- Destructuringin JS: is an operation that allows us to unpack data from an array (or object) into separate variables
- How to use destructuring for swith variables
- Destructuring by using method of object
- Destructuring nested arrays
- Assigment default values during destructuring for unexisting variables

#

## Destructuring-objects

### What I learned:

- How to destructuring objects and nested objects
- How to change the names and mutate variables during destructuring and set default values
- Creation of function that destructuring object immediately with default parametrs

#

## Spread

### What I learned:

- The spread operator can be used to unpack an array or any iterable variable into individual elements
- Use spread operator when we pass arguments into a function
- Copy array, creating a shallow copy, join two arrays
- Make a shallow copy of object using Spread operator (ES2020)

#

## Rest

### What I learned:

- Rest parameter it has the same syntax with the three dots but it actually does the opposite of the spread operator.
- The rest pattern uses the exact same syntax however, to collect multiple elements and condense them into an array or object.
- Rest syntax is on the LEFT side of the assignment operator
- Rest pattern basically collects the elements that are unused in the destructuring assignment.
- Rest pattern always must be the last in the destructuring assignment
- Rest parameter we can use as function argument

#

## Short-circuiting

### What I learned:

- **||** If the first value is true, then it will be returned immediately. The rest of the values will not even be considered.
- **&&** This "short circuit" works in exactly the opposite way. Returns the first false value and stops. If all values are false, then the last false value will be returned.

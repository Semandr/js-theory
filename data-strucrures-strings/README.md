## What I have learned in this section of the JS theory:

- [Destructuring Arrays](#destructing-arrays)
- [Destructuring Objects](#destructuring-objects)
- [Spread Operator (...)](#spread)

## Destructing-arrays

### What I learned:

- Destructuringin JS: is an operation that allows us to unpack data from an array (or object) into separate variables
- How to use destructuring for swith variables
- Destructuring by using method of object
- Destructuring nested arrays
- Assigment default values during destructuring for unexisting variables

#

## Destructuring-objects

### What I learned:

- How to destructuring objects and nested objects
- How to change the names and mutate variables during destructuring and set default values
- Creation of function that destructuring object immediately with default parametrs

#

## Spread

### What I learned:

- The spread operator can be used to unpack an array or any iterable variable into individual elements
- Use spread operator when we pass arguments into a function
- Copy array, creating a shallow copy, join two arrays
- Make a shallow copy of object using Spread operator (ES2020)

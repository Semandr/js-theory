## ARRAYS

### **Intro**:

In JavaScript, arrays are probably the most commonly used data structure.
JavaScript has countless modern array methods that we can also think of as array tools.
In this section, I will be learning all about these tools, how to use them, and more importantly, when to use them.
A small project will be made, so that I can practically learn all these tools for working with arrays.
